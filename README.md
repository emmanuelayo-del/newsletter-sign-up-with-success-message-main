## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Email Regular Expression 
- Screenshoting for mobile and desktop view
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learnt a lot most expecially email regular expression, and how elements override one another and how to debug.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

am still focusing on knowing how to structure my HTML very well.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for understanding HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT AND PYTHON AND C++ AS WELL. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand what is react native . I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
